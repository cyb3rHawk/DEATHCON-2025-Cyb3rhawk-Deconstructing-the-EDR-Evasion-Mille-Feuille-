Welcome, fellow hunters! I’m excited to kick off this workshop with you, and  today is all about leveling up our shared craft as threat hunters and defenders.

The idea behind this workshop sprang when I observed several posts on threat hunting, but every time I read felt like “a fresh start”.   That’s why we are not learning another technique, though I would love you to memorize a new acronym (LAYER). We will dive into the “how” and “why” behind the hunt strategies and connecting the dots between abstractions. This is a bit theory and a bit hands-on to explain Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD) workflow, and your own intuition as hunters.

Objectives for this session:

Break free from checkbox hunting. We’re going to understand hunting EDR “bypass”, using real exploitation, layered methodologies, and patterns adversaries can’t easily shake off.
Decode how techniques like BYOVD, EDR bypass, and evolving toolkits work under the hood, and what this means for your hunts.
Build actionable, modular hunt packages that you can take straight back to your environment.
